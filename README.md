# Churn Prediction for a Telecom Company

### Name / Title of the Project: 
Churn Prediction for a Telecom Company
### Statement about the Problem:
The telecom industry faces significant challenges in retaining customers, with many customers switching to competitors. This issue, known as customer churn, directly impacts revenue and growth. The goal of this project is to predict which customers are likely to leave the service, allowing the company to implement retention strategies proactively.
### Why is the Particular Topic Chosen?:
Churn prediction is crucial for the telecom sector as retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. With fierce competition, predicting customer churn helps maintain profitability and customer satisfaction.
### Objective and Scope of the Project:
The project aims to develop a predictive model to accurately forecast customer churn based on historical data. It involves data collection, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation to reduce churn rates and improve loyalty.
Methodology:
### Data Collection: 
Customer usage patterns, billing history, demographics, and interactions.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, scale features, encode variables.
### Model Development: 
Use algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.
### Evaluation:
 Measure performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
### Tools and Technologies:
Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, MySQL, Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm, Git/GitHub.
